# Naendhar Jangiti - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Narendhar, a data analyst with over 5 years of experience specializing in healthcare and financial analytics. I thrive on turning raw, complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making, optimize operations, and improve both business and patient outcomes. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, I enjoy building predictive models and interactive dashboards that not only reveal trends but also unlock opportunities for growth and efficiency.

My work spans developing machine learning models, automating ETL pipelines, and implementing cloud-based solutions using AWS and Azureâ€”resulting in significant improvements in reporting speed, cost reduction, and data accessibility. I'm deeply committed to maintaining data integrity and compliance, ensuring that every insight is both accurate and secure.

Constantly curious and eager to grow, I stay up to date with advancements in analytics and tech to deliver the best solutions. Let's explore the data-driven future together!

<!-- ## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of completed projects as well as a brief description of each project:

### Covid-19 Data Exploration

**Code:** [`Covid-19 Data Exploration.sql`](https://github.com/ronishahill/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Exploration.sql)

**Goal:** To gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and potential problems of the dataset without formulating assumptions and biases about the data before future use 

**Description:** The dataset used for this project contains records of confirmed Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country from 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Skills:** Joins, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, CTEs, Temp Tables, Creating Views

**Technology:** MySQL

### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

**Code:** [`Nashville Housing Data Cleaning.sql`](https://github.com/ronishahill/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)

**Goal:** To clean the dataset by identifying and correcting incomplete, duplicate, and/or irrelevant data, thus ensuring high quality data for future decision making 

**Description:** The dataset used for this project contains records of houses that have been sold in Nashville, TN between 2013-2019. This project includes the following steps: Data Loading, Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing

**Skills:** Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL)

**Technology:** MySQL

### HR Attrition Dashboard

**Visualization:** [`HR Attrition Dashboard.twb`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ronishahill/viz/HRAttritionDashboard_16969048581520/Dashboard1)

**Goal:** To discover the potential cause and/or causes of employee attrition in order to implement necessary changes to the company's policy and environment to retain employees

**Description:** The dataset used for this project contains information collected by human resources (HR) to understand the factors that lead to an employee leaving the company. This project includes the following steps: Data Export/Import, Data Exploration, and Visualization Creation 

**Skills:** Data Interpretation, Visual & Information Design, Interactive Visualization, User-Interface (UI) Design, Storytelling & Communication, Statistics

**Technology:** Tableau & Microsoft Excel

### Prescription Label Translation

**Goal:** To improve the saftey of medication labels translated and dispensed by the Seattle Children's Hospital Retail Pharmacy to non-English speaking patients

**Description:** The data used for this projects included 35 of the most common prescription order statements used by Seattle Children's Retail Pharmacy. They were then to be translated into 6 languages (Spanish, Amharic, Somali, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese) and validated against exsiting translations provided by a third-party vendor used by the pharmacy for errors and inconsistencies. 

**Findings:** It was found that compared to our translations, the vendor's translations were long and overly complicated. Due to the size of the prescription labels and containers, the order sentences needed to be short and concise. Also, the mistranslation of these sentences could possibly lead to adverse events such as overdose or death. After a final analysis, it was recommended by our team that the pharmacy either: A) Stopped using the vendor or B) Work with the vendor to implement some of our shorter more concise translations. Our finding were then developed into a 45 page written report along with a visual and submitted to the Seattle Children's pharmacy informatics team.

**Skills:** Logical Functions (Google Sheets), Graphs & Charts (Gantt Charts), Project Planning, Project Management 

**Technology:** Google Suite (Google Sheets, Google Docs)
